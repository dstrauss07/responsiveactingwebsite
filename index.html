            <p>You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Good news, everyone! I've
                taught the toaster to feel love! That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much.
                You even love anyone pretending to be him!</p>
            <p>But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Tell her she looks thin. No. We're on the
                top. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.</p>
            <p>We're also Santa Claus! Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that
                there incompetence. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes
                will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</p>

            <p>Moving along… You're going to do his laundry? Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER
                ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. There's one way and only one way to determine
                if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!</p>
            <p>Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. I'm Santa Claus! That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked
                on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Oh God, what have I done? I don't want to be
                rescued.</p>
            <p>Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Oh, how awful.
                Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.</p>
